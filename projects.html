            <h3>Virtual Interface Command and Target Obliterating Robot ( V.I.C.T.O.R ) ü§ñ</h3>
            <p> The proposed system deals with development of defence robotics technology.<br>
                Here, we employ the usage of embedded systems comprising microcontrollers along with wide range 
                of sensors in order to acquire high precision data output.<br> It is a semi autonomous robot with a 
                long distance control, attack, espionage and feedback.<br> This project is a new approach in the domain 
                of defence and obliteration.</p>

            <h3>Home security using Python and OpenCV üè†üîíüõ°Ô∏èüìπ</h3>
            <p>This project uses a combined effort of libraries like keras, imutils, pickle, 
            pandas along with OpenCV to create a home security system. It is developed in python language, 
            making it efficient and convenient to use. Having a 4K HDR camera as its eyes, 
            it can identify threats under all lighting conditions and simultaneously send a live stream to 
            nearby police stations and people lister as emergency contacts to the user. 
            Development is being done to equip weapons in order to downgrade severity of the threat.</p>

            <h3>Spending Insight Pro Model</h3>
            <p>Monthly expenditure analysis using Data science.
            This project involves using numpy, pandas ,seaborn and matplotlib libraries 
            in order to build a model that analyzes the category, amount spent, balance amount 
            and the date on which the purchase was made. The data set was collected from a bank statement 
            of each month and then uploaded.The report is visualized using PowerBI.<br>
            
            <p class="big">Steps performed to implement the model:

            1. Collected data on expenditures, such as amount spent, category, and date.<br>
            2. Uploaded the data into a Python environment using the Pandas library.<br>
            3. Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the data and its distribution.<br>
            4. Visualized the data to identify patterns and relationships.<br>
            5. Performed feature engineering to extract relevant information from the data.<br>
            6. Pre-processed the data by dropping irrelevant columns and one-hot encoding categorical variables.<br>
            7. Split the data into training and testing sets for model building.<br>
            8. Built and trained a regression model using the Random Forest algorithm.<br>
            9. Evaluated the model performance using a metric such as Root Mean Squared Error.<br>
            10.Used the trained model to predict expenditure amounts for new data points, such as for a specific category and date.</p>
