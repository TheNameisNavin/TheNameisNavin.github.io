            <h3>Virtual interface command and target obliterating robot</h3>
            <p>In this proposed system, we deal with the development of defence robotics technology, 
                we employ the usage of embedded systems comprising microcontrollers along with wide range 
                of sensors in order to acquire high precision data output. It is a semi autonomous robot with a 
                long distance control ,attack, espionage and feedback. This project is a new approach in the domain 
                of defence and obliteration.</p>

            <h3>Home security using Python and OpenCV</h3>
            <p>This project uses a combined effort of libraries like keras, imutils, pickle, 
            pandas along with OpenCV to create a home security system. It is developed in python language, 
            making it efficient and convenient to use. Having a high quality camera as its eyes, 
            it can identify threats under all lighting conditions and simultaneously send a live stream to 
            nearby police stations and people lister as emergency contacts to the user. 
            Development is being done to equip weapons in order to downgrade severity of the threat.</p>

            <h3>Spending Insight Pro Model</h3>
            <p>Monthly expenditure analysis using Data science

This project involves using the numpy, pandas ,seaborn and matplotlib libraries in order to build a model that analyzes the category , amount spent , balance amount and the date on which the purchase was made. The data set was collected from my bank statement of each month and then it was uploaded as an Excel workbook. The report was visualized using PowerBI

Steps to implement the model:

1. Collect data on expenditures, such as amount spent, category, and date.
2. Load the data into a Python environment using the Pandas library.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data and its distribution.
4. Visualize the data to identify patterns and relationships.
5. Perform feature engineering to extract relevant information from the data.
6. Pre-process the data by dropping irrelevant columns and one-hot encoding categorical variables.
7. Split the data into training and testing sets for model building.
8. Build and train a regression model using the Random Forest algorithm.
9. Evaluate the model performance using a metric such as Root Mean Squared Error.
10.Use the trained model to predict expenditure amounts for new data points, such as for a specific category and date.</p>
